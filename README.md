# PROJECT STATI:

[![Maintenance status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/one19/project-status/master/cache/project-status/maintained.svg?sanitize=true)](https://github.com/one19/project-status)

---

This is a small repo for checking which of my github repos are under active development. I've been continually frustrated with packages and repos being sunset without explanation, or even saying they've been sunset. I'm fixing it on **here** on my github profile now. If you see a repo of mine that isn't on this list _(unless it's private somehow you sneakthief)_ it isn't actively maintained in any way, and I hereby relinquish all responsibility for its operation, and you may copy/use however you like, any or all of anything you find therein, without referencing me at all. Whatever license they claim to have is null and void.

Also, since I don't want to overwhelm [shields.io](https://shields.io/), and also since I want to make this the sole source of truth for repo status, I'm caching the badges here, and using a pre-commit hook to keep the cache up to date with this README.
Normal badges are pretty standard. The ones here are a custom breed meant to explain a little more of what to expect with these packages.

#### the titles & description pre-list below should be pretty self-evident; if they are not, feel free to ping me on the repo or here, and I **will** explain within one week.

Some repositories will reside inside multiple lists. This usually won't mean something contradictory.

## UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT:

> Any repo here is under my active care. I will respond to issues/pull-requests in a timely fashion. Raise issues, and I **will** generate a pull request promptly to address them.

## BEING-SUNSET:

> Repos and packages here are _practically_ dead. They might work. They are usually a few false-starts or something I fell out of love with. I might respond to prs/issues. Shoot me a message if you have questions.

## HEAVY MAINTENANCE:

> Repos here are generally in the process of great change. I might change them completely from day to day. Don't expect code here to last long in the shape it's in. Issues/prs **will** be considered.

2.  [im-doin-slack](https://github.com/one19/im-doin-slack)
2.  [arum-aruff](https://github.com/one19/arum-aruff)

## STABLE MAINTENANCE:

> Repos here may have big releases that change functionality, but for most purposes, they're not going to greatly evolve on a weekly or monthly basis. Mostly patches and additional things, not full on restructures.
